## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to find temperature trends in Oahu before opening a shop. We wanted to specifically look at the temperature trends for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round. We ran two separate queries and stored the temperatures in a list. Those lists were then converted into a data frame where we were able to get a summary of temperatures for June and December.

## Results:
* One difference between June and December is the count. June had a total count of 1700 while December had a count of 1517. (Count is the number of not-empty values.) This shows that June had more data points than December has.
* There was also a difference of 3.902589 between the mean, a difference of 8 for the minimum temperature and a difference of 2 for the maximum temperature.
* There is a difference of .5 in the standard deviation in the months of June and December.

## Summary:
These results show us that overall, there is a small difference in temperature between June and December. However, there is more queries we can perform. Such as finding the precipitation differences between those months. We could also run queries to find out what month would be the worst for business.
